### Applied Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of practical projects I completed as part of the "Applied Projects with Python + ChatGPT" course on the AlMadrasa platform. These projects were designed to enhance my Python programming skills by solving real-world problems and creating functional applications.

## Projects Overview

 # Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A simple terminal-based game where the user competes against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors. The game continues until the user decides to quit, with results displayed after each round.

# Website Scraper
A Python script that scrapes the Books to Scrape website to extract book titles, ratings (using stars), and prices. The extracted data is displayed in the terminal.

# To-Do List Application
A command-line tool for managing tasks. Users can add tasks, view the list of tasks, and remove tasks. The program continues running until the user decides to exit.

# Guessing Game
A number guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 10. Feedback is provided for each guess, and the user can play multiple rounds until they decide to quit.

# Currency Converter
A Python program that converts amounts between different currencies using the API Layer Currency Data API. Users can view a list of supported currencies and perform real-time conversions by entering valid currency codes and amounts.

# Text Editor
A GUI-based text editor built with tkinter. It allows users to create, open, edit, and save text files. It also includes undo, redo, and exit functionalities, providing a simple yet effective text-editing environment.

# Weather Forecasting Application
A GUI-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can enter a city name to view information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and precipitation.


## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python.
Libraries/Tools:
tkinter for GUI-based applications,
requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping,
APIs for real-time data retrieval (e.g., currency and weather APIs).
